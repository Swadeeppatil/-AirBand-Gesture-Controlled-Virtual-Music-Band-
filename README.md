# -AirBand-Gesture-Controlled-Virtual-Music-Band-
Using real-time computer vision, this project detects and tracks hand gestures to play different musical instruments like drums, piano, guitar, and moreâ€”all rendered virtually on your screen. With intuitive controls, anyone can become a musician without ever touching an instrument.

## Installation and Usage Instructions
1. First, install the required dependencies:
2. Generate the sound files:
3. Run the AirBand application:
4. Use the following gestures to play instruments:
   
   - Open palm: Play drum sound

## How It Works
1. Hand Detection : The application uses MediaPipe Hands to detect and track hand landmarks in real-time from the webcam feed.
2. Gesture Recognition : Based on the positions of hand landmarks, the system identifies different gestures:
   
   - Open palm: All fingertips are above their respective knuckles
   - Closed fist: All fingertips are below their respective knuckles
   - Left/Right swipe: Based on the position of the wrist and thumb relative to the screen
   - Both hands raised: Both hands are detected in the upper half of the screen
3. Sound Playback : When a gesture is detected, the corresponding sound is played using Pygame's mixer.
4. Visual Feedback : The application displays the hand landmarks, the current gesture being performed, and instructions on the screen.
